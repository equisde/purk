## Introduction

Purk is an open source, secure and untraceable cryptocurrency for donations, tips and instant private payments with minimal transaction fees. Based on CryptoNote technology, Purk helps balance CPU, GPU and ASIC mining speeds, which encourages fair and equal distribution whilst providing extremely fast block verification times.

## Purk Button

The Purk Button API is accessible from the GUI wallet. Users can generate an embed code to accept Purk as a donation on their website or application. Visit the "Purk API" page in the GUI wallet to get started. The Purk Button is compatible with Chrome, Firefox, Opera and soon Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer [[1]](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/platform/issues/11963735/). Safari is not supported [[2]](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=171934).

## About this Project

This is the core implementation of Purk. It is open source and completely free to use without restrictions. There are no restrictions on anyone creating an alternative implementation of Purk that uses the protocol and network in a compatible manner.

Anyone is able to contribute to Purk. If you have a bug fix or code change, feel free to submit it as a pull request. In cases where the change is relatively small or does not affect other parts of the codebase it may be merged in immediately by any one of the lead developers. If the change is particularly large or complex, it it will be discussed at length either well in advance of the pull request being submitted, or even directly on the pull request.

## Deployment

### Linux

Tested on Ubuntu 14.04.5 x64. Dependencies: GCC 4.7.3 or later, CMake 2.8.6 or later, and Boost 1.55 or later. You may download them from:

* http://gcc.gnu.org/
* http://www.cmake.org/
* http://www.boost.org/

**Get Required Libraries**

`sudo apt-get update`
`sudo apt-get install build-essential g++ python-dev autotools-dev libicu-dev build-essential libbz2-dev cmake git`

**Install GCC 4.8**

`sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test`
`sudo apt update`
`sudo apt install gcc-4.8`
`sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/gcc gcc /usr/bin/gcc-4.8 50`
`sudo apt install g++-4.8`
`sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/g++ g++ /usr/bin/g++-4.8 50`

**Install Boost**

`mkdir tmp`
`cd tmp`
`wget -O boost_1_55_0.tar.gz https://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost/1.55.0/boost_1_55_0.tar.gz/download`
`tar xzvf boost_1_55_0.tar.gz`
`cd boost_1_55_0/`
`./bootstrap.sh --with-libraries=system,filesystem,serialization,program_options,date_time,thread,regex,atomic,iostreams,log,locale,wave --prefix=/usr/local`
`sudo ./b2 install`
`sudo sh -c 'echo "/usr/local/lib" >> /etc/ld.so.conf.d/local.conf'`
`sudo ldconfig`

**Git Clone**

`git clone https://github.com/purkproject/purk.git`

**Compile Purk**

`cd purk`
`make`

###  MacOS X

Dependencies: GCC 4.7.3 or later, CMake 2.8.6 or later, and Boost 1.55 or later. You may download them from:

* http://gcc.gnu.org/
* http://www.cmake.org/
* http://www.boost.org/

Alternatively, it may be possible to install them using a package manager.

More detailed instructions for OS X (assume you’re using MacPorts (they’re, however, pretty self-explanatory and homebrew users shouldn't have troubles following it too):

* Install latest Xcode and command line tools (these are in fact MacPorts prerequisites)
* Install GCC 4.8 and toolchain selector tool: `sudo port install gcc48 gcc_select`
* Set GCC 4.8 as an active compiler toolchain: `sudo port select --set gcc mp-gcc48`
* Install latest Boost, CMake: `sudo port install boost cmake`

To build, change to a directory where this file is located, and run `make`. The resulting executables can be found in `build/release/src`.

**Advanced options**:

Parallel build: run `make -j<number of threads>` instead of just `make`.

Debug build: run `make build-debug`.

Test suite: run `make test-release` to run tests in addition to building. Running `make test-debug` will do the same to the debug version.

Building with Clang: it may be possible to use Clang instead of GCC, but this may not work everywhere. To build, run `export CC=clang CXX=clang++` before running `make`.

### Windows

Dependencies: MSVC 2012 or later, CMake 2.8.6 or later, and Boost 1.55 or later. You may download them from:

* http://www.microsoft.com/
* http://www.cmake.org/
* http://www.boost.org/

To build, change to a directory where this file is located, and run this commands: 
```bash
 mkdir build
 cd build
 cmake -G "Visual Studio 11 Win64" ..
```

And then do Build.
Good luck!
